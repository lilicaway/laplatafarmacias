<h1>Use this project from Eclipse</h1>

<p>If you want to use this project from Eclipse follow the instructions from <a href="http://googlewebtoolkit.blogspot.com/2010/08/how-to-use-google-plugin-for-eclipse.html">GWT's blog</a>.</p>

<p>
The relevant part is copied here:
</p>

<ol>

<li>In Eclipse, open your project's properties (Alt+Enter or right-click, Properties)</li>
<li>Under Google | App Engine, select the version of the App Engine SDK you're using. GPE is not yet able to use the version defined in your Maven POM, so you may need to download your SDK version using the Eclipse software updater (see http://code.google.com/eclipse/docs/download.html)</li>
<li>Under Google | Web Toolkit, likewise select the version of the GWT SDK you're using. As with the App Engine SDK, install it via the Eclipse plugin update site if needed.</li>
<li>Under Google | Web Application, check the "This project has a WAR directory" box and point it to your project's src/main/webapp directory. This is the standard WAR source folder for Maven Web projects. Be sure that the "Launch and deploy from this directory" box is NOT checked.</li>
<li>Under Java Build Path, select the Order and Export tab and move all Maven dependencies to the BOTTOM. Otherwise, GPE will see the App Engine and GWT SDKs from the Maven repo on the build path and complain that they are not valid. This is because GPE expects a specific SDK structure used to enable other tooling.</li>
<li>Also under Java Build Path, select the Source tab and ensure that the Build output directory is enabled and pointing to target/your-project-name/WEB-INF/classes. If you created the project with mvn eclipse:eclipse, this should be done for you automatically.</li>
<li>Finally, and this is very important, the first time you launch your project using Run As | Web Application (or Debug), you will be prompted to select the war directly. This is NOT src/main/webapp, but rather the WAR output folder, which is target/your-project-name. If you make a mistake, simply go to Run | Run Configurations... and remove any old configurations for the project. GPE will then ask you again next time you try to Run As | Web Application.</li>
</ol>
